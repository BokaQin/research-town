The expected outcome is a significant improvement in both the accuracy and efficiency of video frame interpolation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.", "bleu": 0.25792447688665077, "rouge_l": 0.35633626097867, "gpt_metric_score": 1.0, "bert_score": 0.35951924324035645, "openai_sim": 0.9051526437851182, "voyageai_sim": 0.8428228737189846, "openai_sim_q1": 0.7661738385431128, "openai_sim_q2": 0.7321724000894052, "openai_sim_q3": 0.7673914039290632, "openai_sim_q4": 0.6981782301230997, "openai_sim_q5": 0.6501272397262521, "voyageai_sim_q1": 0.8891209705941584, "voyageai_sim_q2": 0.6794696642201761, "voyageai_sim_q3": 0.7675706712788175, "voyageai_sim_q4": 0.6836814515228143, "voyageai_sim_q5": 0.6389209012365011}
